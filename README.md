#### This API is not production ready.
- Here are some advices for further enhancement of the API:
- Consider implementing a repository pattern for the methods accessing the database. 
- Consider using an auto mapper for mapping DTO's to Entities.
- Consider adding rate limiting and/or authentication/authorization features depending on the type of usage the API will have.
